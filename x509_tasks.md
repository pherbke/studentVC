## X.509 Workflow Implementation

This section documents the complete X.509 integration workflow in the StudentVC system, detailing each step from certificate issuance to credential verification.

### Certificate Chain & DID Creation

The X.509 workflow begins with the creation of a certificate chain and associated DID:

1. **Certificate Chain Generation**:
   - Root CA certificate (self-signed)
   - Intermediate CA certificate (signed by Root CA)
   - End-entity certificate (signed by Intermediate CA)
   - The end-entity certificate includes the DID in the SubjectAlternativeName (SAN) extension

2. **DID Document Creation**:
   - A DID document is created (typically using did:web method)
   - The DID is linked to the end-entity certificate via the SubjectAlternativeName
   - The certificate chain is embedded in the DID document's verification method
   - Format used: `x509CertificateChain` array with each certificate in PEM format

### Credential Issuance Process

The credential issuance process integrates both X.509 and DID-based trust:

1. **Issuer Setup**:
   - Issuer has an X.509 certificate chain and associated DID
   - The DID document includes verification methods with the certificate chain
   - The issuer's certificate SAN includes the DID for bidirectional linkage

2. **Enhanced Issuer Metadata**:
   - Issuer metadata includes X.509 certificate information
   - The issuer's X.509 certificate chain is available for verification

3. **Credential Creation**:
   - Credential is created with standard fields (type, issuer, subject, claims)
   - X.509 metadata is embedded in the credential's `x509` property
   - The complete certificate chain is included in `x509.certificateChain`
   - Subject information is included in `x509.subject`

4. **Credential Signing**:
   - Credential is signed using the issuer's private key
   - The same key is used for both X.509 and DID verification

5. **Dual-Proof Support**:
   - For higher assurance, dual-proof mechanisms are supported
   - Both X.509 and DID-based proofs can be included in the credential

### Credential Holding

The holder (subject) of a credential has the following capabilities:

1. **Secure Storage**:
   - Credentials with X.509 metadata are securely stored in the holder's wallet
   - The complete certificate chain is preserved for future verification

2. **Credential Management**:
   - Holders can view the X.509 certificate details in their credentials
   - Certificate validity is monitored to alert holders of expiring certificates

3. **Presentation Creation**:
   - Holders can create presentations including credentials with X.509 metadata
   - Selective disclosure allows revealing only necessary certificate attributes
   - Both DID and X.509 proofs can be included in presentations

### Verification Process

The verification process supports both DID and X.509 trust paths:

1. **Multi-Path Verification**:
   - Verifiers can choose to verify via DID trust, X.509 trust, or both
   - Verification occurs in parallel, offering multiple trust anchors

2. **X.509 Trust Path Verification**:
   - Extract the certificate chain from the credential
   - Verify the certificate chain against trusted root CAs
   - Check certificate validity, expiration, and revocation status
   - Verify the DID in the certificate's SAN matches the credential issuer

3. **DID Trust Path Verification**:
   - Resolve the issuer's DID to obtain the DID document
   - Validate the credential signature using the verification method
   - Verify the DID document contains the certificate in the verification method

4. **Bidirectional Linkage Verification**:
   - Confirm the certificate contains the DID in its SAN
   - Confirm the DID document references the certificate
   - This bidirectional linkage provides stronger binding between identities

### Integration with BBS+ Signatures

BBS+ signature support is integrated with X.509 certificates:

1. **Enhanced Privacy**:
   - BBS+ signatures allow selective disclosure while maintaining signature validity
   - X.509 credentials can be signed with BBS+ for enhanced privacy

2. **Selective Disclosure of Certificate Data**:
   - Certificate attributes can be selectively disclosed alongside credential claims
   - The holder can prove certificate validity without revealing all certificate data

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - BBS+ key material is derived from or linked to X.509 key material
   - The verification method in the DID document includes both X.509 and BBS+ keys
   - Presentation creation supports selective disclosure of both credential data and certificate attributes

### Integration with OID4VCI and OID4VP

The X.509 functionality is fully integrated with OpenID protocols:

1. **OID4VCI (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance)**:
   - Issuer metadata includes X.509 certificate information
   - Pre-authorized code flow supports X.509-enhanced credentials
   - Authorization code flow integrates X.509 validation
   - Credential offers include X.509 metadata for trust validation
   - Issuance endpoints support X.509 authentication and validation

2. **OID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations)**:
   - Presentation definition supports X.509 trust requirements
   - Presentation submissions include X.509 metadata and proofs
   - Verification services validate both DID and X.509 trust paths
   - QR codes and deep links can request X.509-verified credentials
   - Input descriptors can specify X.509 certificate requirements

### X.509 and Shibboleth Integration Details

Shibboleth already supports X.509 certificates for server authentication and, in some configurations, for client authentication. The integration will build upon this by:

1. **Enhanced Certificate Trust**:
   - Leverage the StudentVC X.509 certificate chain validation for Shibboleth authentication
   - Cross-validate institutional certificates used in both Shibboleth and VC contexts
   - Establish trust relationships between institutional CAs and the Shibboleth federation

2. **Dual-Path Authentication**:
   - Allow authentication through both traditional Shibboleth mechanisms and VC presentation
   - Support transitional deployments where both systems operate in parallel
   - Enable step-up authentication using VCs for accessing sensitive resources

3. **Integration Architecture**:
   - The Shibboleth IdP will integrate with the StudentVC backend for credential verification
   - The StudentVC wallet will implement SAML protocol support for authentication
   - A bridge service will translate between SAML assertions and verifiable presentations

### HAVID Alignment in Shibboleth Context

The Shibboleth integration will adhere to the HAVID specification by:

1. **Bridging Multiple VID Flavors**:
   - SAML entityIDs as an additional VID flavor alongside DIDs and X.509 Subject DNs
   - Establishing bidirectional linkage between SAML identities and DIDs
   - Linking Shibboleth metadata with DID documents for enhanced discovery

2. **Cross-Trust Domain Verification**:
   - Enabling verification across Shibboleth federations and DID trust frameworks
   - Supporting multiple verification paths through X.509, DID, and SAML
   - Providing flexible trust policies for cross-domain authentication

### Sample Integration Flow

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Student accesses a Shibboleth-protected resource (e.g., library database)
   - Student is redirected to institutional Shibboleth IdP
   - IdP offers authentication via the StudentVC wallet
   - Student selects this option and scans QR code or follows deep link

2. **Credential Presentation**:
   - StudentVC wallet receives authentication request with required attributes
   - Wallet identifies matching credentials with selective disclosure options
   - Student consents to share minimal necessary attributes
   - Wallet creates and signs a verifiable presentation

3. **Verification and SSO**:
   - Enhanced Shibboleth IdP verifies the presentation via DID and X.509 paths
   - IdP checks revocation status of the credential
   - IdP generates SAML assertion with attributes from the verified credential
   - Student is redirected to the service provider with appropriate access

4. **Session Management**:
   - Wallet maintains awareness of active Shibboleth sessions
   - Student can view and terminate sessions from the wallet
   - Single logout is supported across all Shibboleth-protected resources
