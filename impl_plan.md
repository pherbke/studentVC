# StudentVC Project Plan - X509compatibility Branch

## 1. Project Overview
- **Goal**: Integrate X.509 certificate support into the StudentVC verifiable credentials system while maintaining BBS+ functionality
- **Core Components**: Issuer, Wallet, Verifier, Revocation
- **Identity Architecture**: DID-based (did:key, did:web, did:shac) + X.509 certificate integration

## 2. Requirements Analysis
- Implement X.509 certificate handling for credential issuers
- Update issuer metadata to include certificate information
- Validate certificate trust chains (GÉANT or DFN CA)
- Maintain W3C VCDM 2.0 compliance
- Support credential status verification
- We need 1000% Shibboleth SAML, Kecloak support for the whole project
- We need a highly professional test suite with all important test categories and tests !!
- We aim for a high nearly 90% Test-Coverage !!!
- We need to have everything tested as senior experts ! 
## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: X.509 Infrastructure Setup (2 weeks)
1. **X.509 Certificate Integration**
   - Implement certificate loading and validation using cryptography.x509
   - Create binding between X.509 certificates and DIDs (did:web, did:shac)
   - Update issuer metadata schema to include certificate information

2. **Trust Chain Verification**
   - Implement trust chain validation logic
   - Add support for GÉANT and DFN CA trust anchors
   - Create certificate storage and management in instance/ directory

### Phase 2: Credential System Updates (3 weeks)
1. **Issuer Service Enhancements**
   - Update credential issuance to include X.509 links
   - Implement dual verification paths (DID + X.509)
   - Modify key management to work with certificate-based identities

2. **Verifier Service Updates**
   - Enhance verification logic to validate X.509 certificates
   - Update trust verification to check certificate validity
   - Implement DID resolution with certificate binding

3. **Status List Implementation**
   - Implement or enhance credential status checking
   - Support states: active, revoked, suspended
   - Create Verkle/IPFS-based revocation mechanism

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (2 weeks)
1. **Test Suite Development**
   - Create test vectors for X.509 + BBS+ credentials
   - Implement end-to-end testing workflow
   - Validate credential roundtrip with all components

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update architecture.md with X.509 integration details
   - Document certificate requirements and trust chain setup
   - Create implementation guide for integrators

### Phase 4: Security Review & Optimization (1 week)
1. **Security Audit**
   - Review cryptographic implementations
   - Validate identity binding security
   - Check for potential attack vectors

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize certificate validation routines
   - Enhance credential verification performance
   - Streamline key management

## 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all cryptographic functions
- Integration tests for the complete credential lifecycle
- End-to-end tests for real-world usage scenarios
- Security testing for potential vulnerabilities

## 5. Deliverables
1. Updated codebase with X.509 integration
2. Enhanced documentation
3. Test suite with X.509 validation
4. Deployment guide for implementation

## 6. Success Criteria
- Successful issuance of credentials with X.509 binding
- Verifiable credentials using both DID and X.509 trust paths
- Functioning revocation system
- Compliance with W3C VCDM 2.0 standards
- Maintained BBS+ selective disclosure functionality

## 7. Timeline
- Total estimated time: 8 weeks
- Phases may overlap based on development progress
- Regular reviews at the end of each phase

## 8. Risk Management
- Cryptographic compatibility issues: Mitigate with careful testing
- Performance concerns: Optimize certificate validation
- Standard compliance challenges: Regular validation against specifications

## 9. Resource Requirements
- Development team familiar with cryptography and identity systems
- Test infrastructure for credential validation
- Certificate authorities for testing
