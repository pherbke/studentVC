## Project Overview

StudentVC is a cross-platform mobile application designed to securely manage, store, and verify academic credentials using Verifiable Credentials (VC) technology. StudentVC leverages BBS+ signatures to ensure cryptographic security and zero-knowledge proof capabilities for selective disclosure of credential attributes - claims.

This project was completed as part of the Internet of Services Lab (IoSL) course during the winter term 2024/25 at [TU Berlin]((https://www.tu.berlin/)). The project was developed by Patrick Herbke, Research Associate at [SNET](https://www.tu.berlin/snet), lead by Prof. Dr. Axel K√ºpper, in collaboration with Christopher Ritter as parther during the IDunion project.

## Key Features

- **Secure Credential Storage:** Safely store academic credentials on mobile devices.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Enable selective disclosure of credential attributes.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Available on Android and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit/).
- **Standards Compliance:** Conforms to [W3C Verifiable Credentials standards v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).
- **BBS+ Signatures:** Robust cryptographic signature scheme for secure credential management - [Rust crate](https://docs.rs/bbs/0.4.1/bbs/).
- **X.509 Certificate Integration:** Support for traditional PKI-based certificate chains and verification.

## X.509 Implementation

The StudentVC platform integrates X.509 certificate technology with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials according to the High Assurance Verifiable Identifiers (HAVID) specification. This integration enables a dual trust model where credentials can be verified through both traditional PKI chains and DID-based verification.

### Key Components

1. **Certificate Chain Integration:**
   - Full X.509 certificate chain support (Root CA, Intermediate CA, End-Entity certificates)
   - Bidirectional binding between X.509 certificates and DIDs
   - DID embedding in certificate SubjectAlternativeName (SAN) extensions

2. **Multi-Issuer Support:**
   - Educational institutions can leverage their own DIDs (e.g., did:web:edu:tu.berlin, did:web:edu:fu-berlin.de)
   - Shared educational PKI for certificate trust
   - DID documents with X.509 verification methods

3. **Dual-Path Verification:**
   - Traditional PKI trust path verification using certificate chains
   - DID-based verification using verification methods
   - Enhanced security through complementary verification approaches

### Implementation Examples

The repository includes detailed examples and simulations:

- [Multi-Issuer X.509 Simulation](/examples/multi_issuer_x509_simulation.py): Demonstrates how multiple educational institutions can use X.509 certificates with their own DIDs
- [X.509 End-to-End Flow](/backend/README_X509_Flow.md): Comprehensive implementation of certificate generation, DID binding, credential issuance, and verification
- [X.509 Integration Details](/examples/README_X509_INTEGRATION.md): Technical details of the X.509 implementation

### Usage

X.509 integration can be used in the following contexts:

```python
# Generate a certificate chain
from src.x509.certificate import generate_certificate_chain

cert_chain, keys = generate_certificate_chain(
    subject_name="did:web:edu:example:issuer#key-1",
    did="did:web:edu:example:issuer"
)

# Add X.509 verification method to DID document
from src.x509.did_binding import add_x509_verification_method_to_did_document

did_document = add_x509_verification_method_to_did_document(
    did_document,
    cert_chain[0],  # End-entity certificate
    verification_method_id,
    ca_certificates=[cert_chain[1], cert_chain[2]]  # Intermediate and Root CA
)

# Embed X.509 metadata in credential
from src.x509.integration import embed_x509_metadata_in_credential

credential_with_x509 = embed_x509_metadata_in_credential(
    credential,
    cert_chain[0],  # End-entity certificate
    ca_certificates=[cert_chain[1], cert_chain[2]]  # Intermediate and Root CA
)

# Verify credential using X.509 trust path
from src.x509.integration import verify_credential_with_x509

is_valid, reason = verify_credential_with_x509(credential, trusted_cas)
```

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Trust:** Combines traditional PKI trust mechanisms with decentralized identity systems
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Works with existing X.509 certificate infrastructure
- **Standards Compliance:** Follows W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model and HAVID specifications
- **Interoperability:** Enables credentials to be verified across different trust domains
