## Project Overview

StudentVC is a cross-platform mobile application designed to securely manage, store, and verify academic credentials using Verifiable Credentials (VC) technology. StudentVC leverages BBS+ signatures to ensure cryptographic security and zero-knowledge proof capabilities for selective disclosure of credential attributes - claims.

This project was completed as part of the Internet of Services Lab (IoSL) course during the winter term 2024/25 at [TU Berlin]((https://www.tu.berlin/)). The project was developed by Patrick Herbke, Research Associate at [SNET](https://www.tu.berlin/snet), lead by Prof. Dr. Axel KÃ¼pper, in collaboration with Christopher Ritter as parther during the IDunion project.

## Documentation & Demo

- [ðŸ“„ Project Report](docs/Mobile_Wallet-Final_Report.pdf) - Detailed documentation and implementation details

## Key Features

- **Secure Credential Storage:** Safely store academic credentials on mobile devices.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Enable selective disclosure of credential attributes.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Available on Android and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit/).
- **Standards Compliance:** Conforms to [W3C Verifiable Credentials standards v2.0] (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).
- **BBS+ Signatures:** Robust cryptographic signature scheme for secure credential management - [Rust crate](https://docs.rs/bbs/0.4.1/bbs/).

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main components:

1. **Android Application** (`/android`): [Native Android implementation] (https://developer.android.com/compose) with credential storage and verification.
2. **iOS Application** (`/ios`): Native iOS implementation with secure credential management.
3. **Backend Services** (`/backend`): Server-side implementation for credential issuance and verification.
4. **BBS Core Library** (`/bbs-core`): Core cryptographic library implementing BBS+ signatures.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio 4.0+ (for Android development)
- Xcode 12.0+ (for iOS development)
- Node.js 14.0+ and npm or yarn (for backend and library)
- MongoDB (for backend data storage)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-wallet.git
cd student-wallet
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Android App Setup

```bash
cd android
./gradlew build
./gradlew installDebug
```

### iOS App Setup

```bash
cd ios
pod install
open StudentWallet.xcworkspace
```

### BBS Core Library Setup

```bash
cd bbs-core
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Usage

1. Set up the BBS core library.
2. Start the backend server.
3. Run the mobile apps on Android or iOS.
