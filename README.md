## Project Overview

StudentVC is a cross-platform mobile application designed to securely manage, store, and verify academic credentials using Verifiable Credentials (VC) technology. StudentVC leverages BBS+ signatures to ensure cryptographic security and zero-knowledge proof capabilities for selective disclosure of credential attributes - claims.

This project was completed as part of the Internet of Services Lab (IoSL) course during the winter term 2024/25 at [TU Berlin]((https://www.tu.berlin/)). The project was developed by Patrick Herbke, Research Associate at [SNET](https://www.tu.berlin/snet), lead by Prof. Dr. Axel KÃ¼pper, in collaboration with Christopher Ritter as parther during the IDunion project.

## Documentation & Demo

## Key Features

- **Secure Credential Storage:** Safely store academic credentials on mobile devices.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Enable selective disclosure of credential attributes.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Available on Android and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit/).
- **Standards Compliance:** Conforms to [W3C Verifiable Credentials standards v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).
- **BBS+ Signatures:** Robust cryptographic signature scheme for secure credential management - [Rust crate](https://docs.rs/bbs/0.4.1/bbs/).

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main components:

1. **Android Application** (`/android`): [Native Android implementation](https://developer.android.com/compose) with credential storage and verification.
2. **iOS Application** (`/ios`): Native iOS implementation with secure credential management.
3. **Backend Services** (`/backend`): Server-side implementation for credential issuance and verification.
4. **BBS Core Library** (`/bbs-core`): Core cryptographic library implementing BBS+ signatures.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio 4.0+](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/05/android-studio-4.html) (for Android development)
- [Xcode 12.0+](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12_0_1-release-notes) (for iOS development)
- [Node.js 14.0+](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.0.0) and npm or yarn (for backend and library)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for backend data storage)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-wallet.git
cd student-wallet
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up --build
```

### Android App Setup

```bash
cd android
./gradlew build
./gradlew installDebug
```

### iOS App Setup

```bash
cd ios
pod install
open StudentWallet.xcworkspace
```

### BBS Core Library Setup

```bash
cd bbs-core
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Usage

1. Set up the BBS core library. The library builds upon the research of [Camenisch et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663.pdf).
2. Start the backend server.
3. Run the mobile apps on Android or iOS.
